/**
 * This class defines meta-information properties, used by the Rule Engine when creating connections between
 * modules.
 * {@link Output}s are the exit point of a {@link Module}. They are used as data source for {@link Input}s of other
 * {@link Module}s.
 * <p>
 * The meta-information contains:
 * <ul>
 * <li>name (mandatory) - unique ID in the scope of the {@link Module}</li>
 * <li>type (mandatory) - the type of the output data. The value of this meta-info property could be any string that
 * makes sense for the user, like a fully qualified name of a Java class, or a general description like "temperature",
 * for example. The type is used to determine which {@link Input} can be connected to this {@link Output}</li>
 * <li>label (optional) - short id (one word) of the Output.</li>
 * <li>description (optional) - user friendly description of the {@link Output}</li>
 * <li>default value (optional) - the string representation of the default value of the {@link Output}.</li>
 * <li>reference (optional) - reference to data source. It defines what part of complex data (i.e. JavaBean,
 * java.lang.Map etc.) has to be used as value of this output.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An {@link Output} can be connected to more than one {@link Input} with a compatible data type.<br>
